# Students blog assessment criteria

[Why blogging?](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging) 

* **Quantity**  
  
	It's good for you to write at least once a week. This means that if a unit is 9 weeks long there should be at least 9 posts.
	
	Each post should be at least 200 words. That's about 10/15 sentences if you're in the business of word-counting.

* **Regularity**  

	Writing all your posts in bulk just before the deadline defeats the purpose of keeping a *blog* to document your creative process.  

* **Quality**

	Use a spell-checker.
	
	Keep your sentences short and make your points sharp.
	
	Avoid repetition and don't blabber on.
	
	Don't write like you speak. Jot down your thoughts and then edit them.

A few connections are made between ideas, but there are very few links and attributions, and little evidence of research.

Images are annotated, they come with descriptions and explanations answering questions such as: what is this sketch about? what's the idea or ideas you're exploring on this sketch? 

Informative but not quite interesting or easy to read. 

Lack of editing and proofreading.
