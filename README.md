# Blogging

Your blog is a **reflection** and creative process **documentation tool**. 

We don’t ask you to blog to fill your time. Documenting your project through a blog helps you develop your **critical thinking and analysis skills**. Just writing all positive, unspecific things about a project doesn’t exercise those analytic mind muscles.

- [ ] We discussed blogging on week 5 of the Dynamic Web 2014 course, here are some [notes from that day](https://github.com/matteomenapace/rave-WEB14203/blob/master/notes/week-5.md#general-observations) to integrate here.
