# Why blogging?

> What are the reasons that stop you (as a student and creative professional) from blogging regularly?

Common answers:

* I don't know what to write about.
* I feel like I am no expert.
* Nobody is going to read it.
* It takes too long.
* It doesn't look good.
* I know what I'm doing so there's no need to write it down.

Let's not call it a *blog*, but rather an **online sketchbook**. 

Creative people have been using sketchbooks for centuries to jot down ideas, record conversations, remember things, plan projects, doodle...

It's place to think.

Sketching and writing (whether is on paper or digital) helps you:

* Learn from what you've made
* Figure out your next step
* Document your creative **process**
* Reflect on your **progress**
* Realise that after all you have actually done something today :smile:

<!--We don’t ask you to keep an *online sketchbook* to fill your time. Documenting your project through a blog helps you develop your **critical thinking and analysis skills**. Just writing all positive, unspecific things about a project doesn’t exercise those analytic mind muscles.-->

It's a **mindset**.

### Tips

1. Don't write a primary school log of what we've done in class (aka `regurgitation`). We know what we've done in class already. 

	Note what you've learned and why you think it's **relevant**. Or **boring**, or **confusing**.

* Aim to **explain and entertain**. Make it enjoyable for people to read. Remember that you're primarily writing for yourself, but it's much more fun to write with **someone else** in mind!

* You can **ask questions** in your posts, from the obvious `What do you think?` to the specific `Which colours should I use for my background?`. **Involve** your reader(s)! 

* The Web wouldn't be a Web without **[hyperlinks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)**! Use plenty of them.

* **Paragraphs** are a good thing! When you see a block of text that is longer than 5 lines (for instance on FB), do you want to read it? Or do you find yourself skimming over it?  
 
* Use headings, sub-headings, **bold** and *italics* to give your posts a **visual rhythm**. These will allow readers to `scan` for keywords before they actually start to `read` your posts. 

* **Images**: make them big! There's nothing more painful (typographically) than squinting your eyes to try and make sense of an image, with text wrapping around it.
