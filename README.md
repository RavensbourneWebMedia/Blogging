# Why blogging?

Your blog is a **reflection** and creative process **documentation tool**. 

We don’t ask you to blog to fill your time. Documenting your project through a blog helps you develop your **critical thinking and analysis skills**. Just writing all positive, unspecific things about a project doesn’t exercise those analytic mind muscles.

## Some tips

1. Please don't write a primary school log of what we've done in class (aka `regurgitation`). We know what we've done in class already. 

	Tell us what you've learned and why you think it's **relevant**. Or **boring**, or **confusing**.

* Aim to **explain and entertain**. Make it enjoyable for people to read. Remember that you're primarily writing for yourself, but it's much more fun to write with **someone else** in mind!

* You can **ask questions** in your posts, from the obvious `What do you think?` to the specific `Which colours should I use for my background?`. **Involve** your reader(s)! 

* The Web wouldn't be a Web without **[hyperlinks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)**! Use plenty of them.

* **Paragraphs** are a good thing! When you see a block of text that is longer than 5 lines (for instance on FB), do you want to read it? Or do you find yourself skimming over it?  
 
* Use headings, sub-headings, **bold** and *italics* to give your posts a **visual rythm**. These will allow readers to `scan` for keywords before they actually start to `read` your posts. 

* **Images**: make them big! There's nothing more painful (typographically) than squinting your eyes to try and make sense of an image, with text wrapping around it.
