_This is a template for a **reflection** blog post, appropriate for the beginning of a unit or project._


### What do you want to get out of this unit/project?

List **at least 3 goals**. 

Try not to use vague phrases such as *I want to learn aboutâ€¦* If you are too vague, then how will you know when you reach your goal? Use an *action word* to describe what you want to achieve. Using an action word makes sure your goal is measurable. Examples of action words are:

* develop 
* plan 
* design 
* compare 
* describe 
* explain 
* create

### Why are these goals important to you?

As a student, as a person, and/or as a creative professional.

### Where do you currently stand?

What are your **strengths** and your **weaknesses**? 

How do you intend you develop them further? 

Who do you admire? What can you learn from them?

### How do you intend to achieve your goals?

What small steps could you take towards making it happen?

How do you learn best? What hinders your learning?

What are you proud of in your learning and what do you wish you could do better?

### Could you summarise your intentions in one word?


# Things to consider

### Why should I do this?

**Reflection** is what happens when you are in front of a **mirror**. You can see yourself, think about your appearance, and change it based on the information that the mirror offers you.

Imagine **a world without mirrors** (and without cameras to take *selfies*). How would your self-perception change in such a world? Would you feel bigger, or smaller, more beautiful, or uglier?

Likewise, imagine a student who doesn't reflect on her learning. 

### SMART goals

[Some people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) argue that effective goals are SMART

1. **Specific** Details, details, details. What do you really want to learn?
2. **Measurable** How can you measure the results of your learning? Where do you currently stand, and how much do you want to change?
3. **Attainable** Challenge yourself, but not so much that you become overwhelmed. How can you achieve your goals?
4. **Realistic** Can you do it? How much effort do you need?
5. **Timely** What can I do today? What can I do every day? What can I do 12 weeks from now? What's your deadline?

A SMART learning goal is structured so that anyone who reads your goal statement will
understand what you want to learn. Here are two examples of SMART goals:

* `I want to build a custom WordPress theme for my uncle's business by December 9`
* `I want to run the local charity 5k race on June 15`
